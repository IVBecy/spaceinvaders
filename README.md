# Space Invaders (Python Implementation)

**NOTE:** On both, the PY and the exe file, keep the pictures in the same folder as the master file itself. (Otherwise it won't run)

**Description**
- 14 enemies, against one player
- You can only fire if, your bullet has reached the top of the screen
- If you die your score will be zero, but your high-score will keep it for you. (Loses after closing the game)
- There are infinite amount of waves
- The enemies are shooting randomly

**If you do not have Python, just use the exe version**
*Find the exe version, in the "exe" folder*
